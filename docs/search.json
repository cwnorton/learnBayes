    "text": "Installation\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nIf you have previously installed the C++ toolkit, CmdStan and/or cmdstanr, or if you have recently updated your OS, please follow these instructions to reinstall them.\n\n\nNow you will need to install a few packages and extra software.\nHere is an overview of what you will install:\n\nC++ toolchain.\nR packages: tidyverse, remotes, cmdstanr, brms.\nCmdStan (including Stan).\n\n\n1. Install the C++ toolchain\nSome of the software (CmdStan) used in the workshop requires a working C++ toolchain for compilation.\nYou can find information on how to set up the C++ toolchain in Section 1.2.1 of the CmdStan User’s Guide.\nMake sure to follow the instructions for your operating system.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCaution\n\n\n\nWINDOWS USERS: The installation process for Windows is more complex than that on Unix/macOS, so pay extra attention in reading the instructions.\nMany attendants with a Windows laptop forget to follow some of the steps (in particular, make sure you are updating the PATH variable as instructed).\n\n\n\n\n2. Install the R packages\nYou need to install the following packages:\ninstall.packages(c(\"tidyverse\", \"remotes\"))\nremotes::install_github(\"stan-dev/cmdstanr\")\ninstall.packages(c(\"brms\"))\ninstall.packages(c(\"tidybayes\", \"extraDistr\"))\nThe cmdstanr package is an interface between R and CmdStan (see below), while brms is the package you will use to run Bayesian linear models (think of it as the Bayesian equivalent of lme4).\nIt will take several minutes to install the packages, depending on your system and configuration.\nIf after opening the Starter Kit in RStudio you get asked to install extra packages or software, please do so.\n\n\n3. Install CmdStan\nNow that you have installed the R packages, you need to install CmdStan.\nCmdStan is a shell interface to the programming language Stan.\nStan is what runs the Bayesian models, but you don’t have to know Stan, because you will use the R packages to run the models (those packages will communicate with Stan in your stead).\nTo install CmdStan, run the following command in the R console:\ncmdstanr::install_cmdstan(cores = parallel::detectCores(), overwrite = TRUE)\n\n\nCheck your installation\nRun the following in the RStudio Console.\nlibrary(cmdstanr)\nfile &lt;- file.path(cmdstan_path(), \"examples\", \"bernoulli\", \"bernoulli.stan\")\nmod &lt;- cmdstan_model(file, force_recompile = TRUE)\ndata_list &lt;- list(N = 10, y = c(0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1))\nfit &lt;- mod$sample(\n  data = data_list, \n  seed = 123, \n  chains = 4, \n  parallel_chains = 4,\n  refresh = 500 # print update every 500 iters\n)\nIf everything goes well you should see Compiling Stan program… and then Running MCMC with 4 parallel chains… followed by information on chains and iterations."

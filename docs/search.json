Install the C++ toolchain\nThe package brms used in the workshop requires a working C++ toolchain to compile models.\n\nWindows\nFor Windows, follow the instructions here: https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/rtools43/rtools.html\n\n\nmacOS\nFor macOS, open the Terminal and write the following line then press enter/return:\nxcode-select --install\nYouâ€™ll see a panel that asks you to install the Xcode Command Line Tools. Install them. Downloading and installation will take 30 to 60 minutes.\n\n\nLinux\nFor Linux, follow the instructions here: https://github.com/stan-dev/rstan/wiki/Configuring-C-Toolchain-for-Linux\n\n\n\n2. Install the R packages\nYou need to install the following packages:\ninstall.packages(c(\"tidyverse\", \"brms\", \"tidybayes\", \"extraDistr\"))\nIt will take several minutes to install the packages, depending on your system and configuration.\nIf after opening the Starter Kit in RStudio you get asked to install extra packages or software, please do so.\n\n\nCheck your installation\nRun the following in the RStudio Console:\nexample(stan_model, package = \"rstan\", run.dontrun = TRUE)\nIf you see some strange looking text printed in the Console and then fit and fit2 in the Environment, then you are sorted!"
